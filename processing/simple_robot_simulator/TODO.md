# Known Issues and Work Items

1. Notify user to press "A" to enable gamepad.
1. Scan code and .md files for typos
1. Consider allowing 2 robots controlled by 2 gamepads. "Start + A" or "Start + B" can identify different gamepads,
   and robots can be given differnt colors or labels to identify these - maybe just A and B.
1. Add collision physics for the 4 corners of the robot against the 4 walls (for a start). Assume frictionless
   contact - so force is normal to the wall and pretty high in magnetude for as long as there is contact. See NOTES
