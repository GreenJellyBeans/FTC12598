# A Simple Robot Simulator
This is a Processing-based simulator for FTC robots. It is a very simple 2D simulation environment, designed for early prototyping and testing of autonomous code by FTC team 12598 and potentially other teams. All code is free to be used
for any purpose without attribution.

The NOTES.md file is a set of dated informal design and implementation notes that chart the development course of this
project. The TIDO.md file contains a list of open issues.

Processing is a wonderful interactive programming environment - see www.processing.org. This program uses
the standard Processing environment - v3 or later, with the following standard libraries loaded:
 G4P and Game Control Plus - these are just for gamepad integration.
Libraries are loaded from the Tools > Add Tool menu, and then selecting the Libraries tab.

Currently the only Gamepad controller supported is the Logitec Gamepad F310 - though it seems easy to
add other controllers using the Game Control Plus library and supporting UX. See http://lagers.org.uk/gamecontrol/

To run (after installing Processing and the required libraries mentioned earlier),
just click on simple_robot_simuator.pde and then click on the play icon.
